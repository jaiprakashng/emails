                            We have <strong>less than a month </strong> before the Meet, Mingle, and Meditate event with Sadhguru in January. As all of us eagerly await to be with Sadhguru in this event, <strong>we want to share the status and also remind that this is the time to boost all our efforts in reaching out to people</strong>. We had a very fruitful discussion in last meeting and we would like to list down the key points below.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                            <p class="highlight bold">Status </p>
                            <p>
                            We have crossed the enrolment of 2000 people for the event and based on our website reports, at least 8000 people have visited the booking site. Please keep in mind that usually one person registers for 2 people on an average.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            When we discussed this amongst us in last volunteer meeting as to why people have not registered in spite of visiting booking site, many responded that people have been thinking that it is too early to confirm for the event. On further probing, it was clear that for many, it’s not about early or late, it has still not become a priority. They are sitting on the edge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Please note that we have festive offer available now for very limited time!
                            </p>
                        <br>
                            <p class="highlight bold">
                            So, what can we do to make it a priority?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Word of mouth has always been the biggest source of many to get introduced to Sadhguru.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many times based on our prejudices, we decide not to share this information thinking perhaps the other person is not ready. It can be surprising to know that most unexpected people are the ones who turn up rather than those whom we expected.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So let us reach out to all whom we know (and do not)! These can be people working under you, coworkers, friends, people on street and even people from nearby countries like Thailand, Indonesia etc!
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    <p class="highlight bold">
                        WhatsApp
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            Spend few minutes daily to forward sadhguru’s content to those you know.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em><strong>Sharing</strong></em> - one of the tamilnadu volunteers shared that recent isha yoga program in ashram by Sadhguru is a live example of how they reached out to 21k enrolment just using this simple tool WhatsApp and a simple feature broadcast list.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em><strong>What is a broadcast list?</strong></em> - You can share any message with multiple people through WhatsApp with just one click if you have a broadcast list. Please note this is NOT a GROUP, which means they receive the message like one to one communication. However for them to receive it, they need to have your phone stored in their phonebook.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em><strong>How to create a broadcast list?</strong></em> - Few of our volunteers created a simple video to highlight the importance of sharing Sadhguru’s words either in video or article through WhatsApp or Facebook. This has the potential of creating exponential reach if only we can invest time in this and it won’t take more than 5 mins.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Few of the sharing after volunteers learnt to create this list in last volunteer meet:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create a broadcast list to send content to many in one click!</li>
                            <li>Send the content also to various whatsapp groups like university interest groups, apartment groups, moms group etc.</li>
                            <li>You can also share Facebook posts in other Facebook groups like expat groups etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            <em><strong>WhatsApp message content</strong></em> - Many of you must be receiving 5 mins volunteering messages since October. The idea of these messages was that all of us could forward the content further to our contacts (through broadcast list or selected contacts).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However we received the feedback that either we have not understood the purpose of these messages or they are too long and monotonous and few don’t feel like forwarding these again. We also received various suggestions on how the content can be made very creative and interesting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, based on various suggestions, we have tweaked these messages to short yet simple and interesting. The idea of these messages is just to help you find the content. All of you can find this online anyhow in isha blog or youtube.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Select the right content for target audience based on kind of personality!</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For those who are working professionals, something related to work life, productivity and success might be suitable while for housewives, food and body book, recipes, lifestyle related content will be more suitable. A lot of content is also very generic on which Sadhguru has spoken like new year resolutions, trump being selected which is the hot topic in news anyhow and can be easily forwarded to anyone without sounding too spiritual.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Few volunteers also wanted to be part of the Social Media team which chooses the content, if any of you would like to contribute here, please contact Neelesh at +65 9101 4421
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="highlight bold">
                        Share your experience with Sadhguru
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            If coming in touch with Sadhguru has transformed your life in some way, isn’t it important to share with others? If we come across something good - good movie, good food, we do share then why not life transforming tools?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many volunteers have started to share their experience with Sadhguru on Facebook, which is causing a silent and subtle effect on friends and relatives. For many who shared, their friends (or not) have commented/contacted wanting to know more about this. This is silently creating a curiosity amongst those not in touch, wanting to know.
                        </p>

                            We received a feedback that due to lack of offline tickets to the event, we were not able to book many who had made up their mind or/and were not comfortable online. So, we have finally created offline tickets for both the chinese categories and last 2 categories.
