            <p>
                We look forward to welcoming you to the Angamardhana program on Saturday 20 August at the St Augustine's
                Anglican church, Hamilton. Due to an internal error on our part the session timings have not been listed
                correctly.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight bold">The session timings are</p>
                <ul class="bold">
                    <li>8:30 am to 12:00 pm</li>
                    <li>5:00 pm to 8:30 pm</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                The reason for the second session to start at 5PM is to ensure that you have had a gap or at least four
                hours after lunch before you begin the second session. Having said this, our Hatha Yoga teacher will
                make announcements at the venue and will do his best to end the second session earlier. We deeply regret
                if this is going to cause anyone inconvenience.
