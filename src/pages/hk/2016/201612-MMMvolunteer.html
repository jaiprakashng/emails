                <strong> We want to share the status and also remind that this is the time to boost all our efforts in reaching out to people</strong> . We had a very fruitful discussion in last meeting and we would like to list down the key points below.

                Word of mouth has always been the biggest source of many to get introduced to Sadhguru.

            <p>
                Many times based on our prejudices, we decide not to share this information thinking perhaps the other person is not ready. It can be surprising to know that most unexpected people are the ones who turn up rather than those whom we expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                So let us reach out to all whom we know (and do not)! These can be people working under you, coworkers, friends, people on street and even people from nearby countries like Thailand, Indonesia etc!

                    You can share any message with multiple people through WhatsApp with just one click if you have a broadcast list. Please note this is NOT a GROUP, which means they receive the message like one to one communication. However for them to receive it, they need to have your phone stored in their phonebook.

            <li>
                Many of you must be receiving 5 mins volunteering messages since October. The idea of these messages was that all of us could forward the content further to our contacts (through broadcast list or selected contacts).
            </li>
            <li>
                However we received the feedback that either we have not understood the purpose of these messages or they are too long and monotonous and few don’t feel like forwarding these again. We also received various suggestions on how the content can be made very creative and interesting.
            </li>
            <li>
                So, based on various suggestions, we have tweaked these messages to short yet simple and interesting. The idea of these messages is just to help you find the content. All of you can find this online anyhow in isha blog or youtube.

                For those who are working professionals, something related to work life, productivity and success might be suitable while for housewives, food and body book, recipes, lifestyle related content will be more suitable. A lot of content is also very generic on which Sadhguru has spoken like new year resolutions, trump being selected which is the hot topic in news anyhow and can be easily forwarded to anyone without sounding too spiritual.

            <p>
                We have created a content repository now containing the most popular whatsapp content as suggested by various volunteers. Please use PInterest board to choose what you want to forward to different kinds of people.

                <em>
                “ My first encounter with Sadhguru was through a video called Introduction to Inner Engineering that a friend forwarded.
                At that point of time, I was not at all looking for a Guru. I thought I had figured out most of the things in life anyway. I was fairly successful in everything I had wanted to do. I also firmly believed that whatever I set my mind to, I can do it very well. At one level, this led to a certain lack of interest in the things around me as I didn't really find anything challenging anymore. I had well formulated theories about everything I could think of. And I had figured out life. So why would I need a Guru.
                Then I came across this video where this guy with an impressive beard is talking about engineering yourself in a very scientific and logical way. It was hard to ignore his logic. This triggered my curiosity and I thought OK this guy deserves a bit of my time and attention. I'll go and listen to what he has to say. So I signed up for the Inner engineering course and started this simple practice.
                My first physical encounter with him was at a evening sathsang in Ashram. The first sentence he uttered completely blew my mind. It was exactly something I was always running from but at the same time always knew to be true. He spoke about how if we don't go beyond the limitations of our mind we can't know life in its entirety. Mind is the only thing I had worked on till then, and I had seen it's limitations. After that he answered many questions people asked but it felt like everything was being said to me personally. I secretly thought that this is all a setup to get me here and tell me all these things I needed to hear. I wondered how he knew me so well. I wondered if he ever came to Chandigarh when I was a young boy and saw me and knew exactly who I was.
                Then again I saw him at ashram at one more evening sathsang and while leaving he just looked at me once. It was just a glance, but I felt like he knew exactly who I am. Like he knew much more about me than myself. It's hard to forget the intensity in his eyes. Hard to forget and hard to explain.
                Since then I've seen him only a few times in person but the intimacy of this bond has grown beautifully with time. What started as a pure intellectual pursuit, perhaps an intellectual challenge, has now evolved into a loving long distance relationship. In any normal circumstances one could call it one sided love affair. But with Sadhguru, it would be a big mistake to call it one sided.”

                We received a feedback that due to lack of offline tickets to the event, we were not able to book many who had made up their mind or/and were not comfortable online. So, we have finally created offline tickets for both the chinese categories and last 2 categories.
