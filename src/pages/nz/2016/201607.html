               Sathsang means "Communion with Truth". The Sathsang creates an environment in which we can become more
               receptive to higher states of awareness. It is an opportunity for us to come together, focus and
               recharge ourselves in the company of other meditators.
           </p>
            <p>
               Please note that this sathsang is open only to those members who have completed online Inner
                Engineering programme or both IE/Shambhavi Mahamudra in one of the centres.
            </p>
            <p>
               To offer the taste of this monthly group meditation to all of us, one of the Ishangas will be flying
                from Melbourne, Australia. We request you to contribute to share and offset this expense after the
                session.

                Bhava Spandana Program (BSP) is a 4-day, 3-night, residential program offered to those who have been
                initiated into Shambhavi Mahamudra. This advanced meditation program is designed by Sadhguru to provide
                an opportunity to experience higher levels of consciousness, beyond the limitations of body and mind.
                BSP offers the experience of a world of limitless love and joy.
            </p>
            <p>The word Bhava literally means
                “sensation.” Spandana can be loosely translated as “resonance.” Through powerful processes and
                meditations, the Bhava Spandana Program creates an intensely energetic situation, where individuality
                and the limitations of the five sense organs can be transcended, creating an experience of oneness and
                resonance with the rest of existence.
