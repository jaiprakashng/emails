               Sathsang means "Communion with Truth". The Sathsang creates an environment in which we can become more
               receptive to higher states of awareness. It is an opportunity for us to come together, focus and
               recharge ourselves in the company of other meditators.
           </p>
            <p>
               Please note that this sathsang is open only to those members who have completed online Inner
                Engineering programme or both IE/Shambhavi Mahamudra in one of the centres.
            </p>
            <p>
               To offer the taste of this monthly group meditation to all of us, one of the Ishangas will be flying
                from Melbourne, Australia. We request you to contribute to share and offset this expense after the
                session.

                We are delighted to inform you that we will be conducting free Isha Upa Yoga sessions
                (in english) in Auckland.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upa Yoga is a simple yet powerful system of exercise that activates the joints, muscles, and energy system. Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, Upa Yoga dispels inertia in the body’s energy and brings ease to the whole system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the human system, the energy flows along 72,000 pathways called nadis. At the joints, the nadis meet and form nodes, making the joints storehouses of energy. Upa Yoga activates this energy and also lubricates the joints, creating an instant sense of alertness and liveliness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upa Yoga essentially means “sub-yoga” or “pre-yoga”. Because of its many immediate and evident benefits, the word Upa Yoga in Indian languages is commonly used to denote “usefulness.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Upa Yoga has numerous benifits</strong> 
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strengthens and stabilizes the spine, can relieve back pain, stress & anxiety.</li>
                    <li>Can relieve from chronic ailments and improves overall health.</li>
                    <li>Does not require any fitness level or previous exposure to yoga.</li>
