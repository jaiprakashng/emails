                Hope you are doing well and enjoying your Shambhavi Mahamudra kriya. We are very happy to pass on a
                personal message from Sadhguru as you take part in this amazing journey of inner transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many articles and videos of Sadhguru explaining different aspects of yoga, life and other
                pragmatic questions in his unmistakable wit and humour. You can use them as a support for your kriya.

            <p>Isha New Zealand started conducting group meditation sessions for those initiated into Shambhavi.
                It is an opportunity to reconnect with your kriya with Sadhguru guiding you through the Shambhavi
                practice. You can also get your kriya corrected by trained volunteers and enjoy lovely guided
                meditations and exclusive videos screened at these sessions.</p>
