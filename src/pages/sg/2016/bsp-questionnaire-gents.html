            <p>
                For you to experience BSP in best possible way, it is mandatory that you write a certain preparatory homework;
                please <a href="http://goo.gl/oIIU8t">click here</a> to download the homework sheet.<br>
                It is best you write as much as possible to enhance your experience though a minimum of 5 hours
                need to be spent in writing this homework before the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>But for your own benefit, it is highly recommended to spend as much time as possible</strong> beyond the 5 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                The time spent need not be continuous, but you can write it at your convenience.<br>
                Please note that it is strictly for your own use only and you will not be required to show your homework to anyone else during the program.<br>
                Please ensure you bring your homework notebook along when you come for the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will send another communication regarding logistics closer to the program date. We look forward to seeing you on the program day!<br>
