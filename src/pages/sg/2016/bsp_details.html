                    Bhava Spandana is like making a person jump and look beyond the wall.
                    He sees beyond his limitation experientially. Once he sees that, he knows that he must go over the wall one day to see what is on the other side.

                We are excited to announce that a Bhava Spandana Program (BSP) will be offered in Johor, Malaysia in September  2016,
                jointly organised by Isha Malaysia and Isha Singapore.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bhava Spandana Program (BSP) is a 4-day, 3-night residential program offered to those who have been initiated into Shambhavi Mahamudra.
                This advanced meditation program is designed by Sadhguru to provide the opportunity to go beyond the limitations of body and mind and experience higher levels of consciousness.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Bhava Spandana program, no matter where it is conducted creates an intensely energetic situation,
                where individuality and the limitations of the five sense organs can be transcended,
                creating an experience of oneness and resonance with the rest of existence.
                Sadhguru has now made this program available in many localities besides the Isha Yoga Center,
                as this is an important step in ones Inner journey and he wants as many people to take this pivotal step as soon as possible.

                "I carried a mountain of pain and fear with me into BSP and I thought that this was a burden I would bear for the rest of my life.
                By the end of the program, I laid that burden down for good and walked away from it.
                I felt that I was truly free to start anew and chose how I wanted to live my life. The indescribable love, joy and connection to life that
                I experienced in BSP still resides within me and sustains me today."

            <p>
               On this Spot, Sadhguru points out what it takes to move from stagnation to growth on the spiritual path.
                As a first step, he suggests examining the following question for ourselves: “What is that one handicap
                in your life that does not allow you to be more spiritual?” In the next step, Sadhguru addresses some of
                the most common obstacles, and how to transcend them.
