            <p>
                The full moon day in the month of Ashadha (July-August) is known as Guru Purnima.
                This sacred day honors the ancient lineage of enlightened beings who have graced the world with their presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                And a Guru is like a road-map; without the guidance of such a teacher one may eventually reach the desired
                destination, but it could take a very long time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The day of Guru Purnima is traditionally the time when seekers express their gratitude to the Guru
                and receive his blessings. Guru Purnima is also considered an especially beneficial day to practice our yoga and meditation.
