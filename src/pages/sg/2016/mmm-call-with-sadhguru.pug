            We have only 25 days remaining before we experience the presence of Sadhguru in Singapore on 22nd January.
            As with any Isha event, big or small, it is the volunteers that contribute in making the event happen.
            Due to the scale of the upcoming January event, we encourage as many people as possible to volunteer.
        p.
            It is not necessary to book seats for the event if you want to volunteer.
            However, if you have already booked seats, you can still volunteer.
        p.
            If you want to volunteer for this event, we urge you to finish your volunteer registration by 2nd January
