            <p>Most of you might already know that Isha Yoga is run entirely by volunteers. On many occassions
                Sadhguru has spoken how volunteering is an essential part of one’s inner growth. To read more,

                It was highly motivating to see a large number of new volunteers turning out for September volunteer meet. Many of you submitted the forms to register your preference to volunteer for various activities in the upcoming programmes as well as January event with Sadhguru. For those who could not make it in September but you would like to volunteer regularly,
                you can register your interest as a volunteer <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F55tf46mxDIEyrp5l6ZtWE0pMeGFHbtCES-4iLc1mQI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The upcoming Volunteer Meet on Oct 22 will focus on Sadhguru’s January event besides regular Isha programs and is mandatory for all who wish to volunteer for this event.</p>

                This is an opportunity to mingle outside for a nature walk amidst fresh air, chirping birds and green trees.
                So, get your walking shoes and join us along with your family for this walk followed by breakfast. After breakfast, we will proceed straight for volunteer meeting. We look forward to seeing many of you on 22nd morning.
