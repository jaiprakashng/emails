            <p>Do you remember your first encounter with Sadhguru?</p>
            <p>Whether it was that video you accidentally clicked that ended up captivating you, or that book you happened to pull off a bookstore shelf and could not stop reading, or that television channel you flipped… you found him!  His wisdom, piercing logic and deep level of clarity, lit a spark within. And, since that moment, our lives have been so distinctly enriched that in various ways we have asked ourselves, "How do I share this?"</p>
            <p>Some choose to speak up and inspire others. Some cannot put their experience into words. Some become involved as volunteers and teachers. Some, with fully loaded careers and family lives, find their own ways, from small to big, as undercover yogis, to sneak in a little yoga into their lives and into that of those around them. </p>
            <p>If you are looking for ways to share this, please read on and inspire others to experience Sadhguru this January and, in turn, help light up a spark within others.</p>

                As with any Isha event, big or small, it is the volunteers that contribute to making the event happen. Due to the scale of the upcoming January event, we encourage as many people as possible to volunteer. <strong>It is not necessary to book seats for the event if you decide to volunteer.</strong> However, if you have already booked seats, you can still register as a volunteer.

            <p>* Please read the entire email before you fill the volunteer registration form to get more clarity on various options.</p>

            <p>
                Sadhguru has inspired meditators in a London sathsang to dedicate at least 1 hour a day to see that what has been
                so valuable in our lives also reaches others. We are requesting for at least 5 minutes of your time daily to spread this.
                If you have 5 minutes, you can help in online promotion, and, if you 15 minutes or more you can help in flyer and poster distribution,
                amongst other things. Here are all the ways in which you can volunteer for the January event:
