                Volunteering being at the very core of Isha, it is with great joy that we announce that the registrations for the <strong>Meet, Mingle and Meditate with Sadhguru in Singapore</strong> Programme are now open.
            </p>
            <p class="justify">
                Speaking of volunteering, one doesn’t have to do the big things to make a difference; it is how it is done that makes all the difference. Here, the Master explores the essence and importance of volunteering: <a href="http://isha.sadhguru.org/mission/volunteering/">Click here</a>
            </p>
            <p class="justify">
                The preparations for <strong>Meet, Mingle and Meditate with Sadhguru in Singapore </strong>have begun in a big way and this is your opportunity to be a part. There are various ways you could contribute depending on the time you have. We are looking for  willing hearts to help with various activities including Flyer Distribution, placing of posters, Standees and Banners across the island, making calls to prospects from the comfort of your home, reaching out to Centre of Influence in organisations for Corporate Outreach amongst others. There is always something you can help with. Even if you have registered for the programme you could still contribute while attending the session.

                This volunteer meet could be your first step towards your own spiritual journey and also be an opportunity to be a part of the strong foundation of volunteers in Singapore, who will have the privilege and joy of taking Sadhguru to larger number of people and being part of the spiritual movement in this part of the world. We look forward to working with you to give this mega programme a shape and wish that you explore volunteering as a catalyst to further your spiritual journey on one hand, and extend this possibility to people around you on another.

                About Sadhguru
            </p>
            <p class="justify">
                Sadhguru is a realized yogi, mystic and visionary who has dedicated himself to the elevation of the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of all people. He is an author and opinion maker who is regularly invited to speak at leading international forums. He has spoken at many prestigious global conferences such as World Peace Summit at the United Nations and the World Economic Forum.
            </p>
            <p class="justify">
                Sadhguru is often described as a contemporary spiritual leader, since he belongs to no particular tradition and incorporates aspects of yogic sciences that are most relevant for modern-day life into his teachings and practices. His scientific methods for self-transformation have universal appeal. Sadhguru's insights into the mechanisms of life are an outcome of his profound experience of the Self, and serve as a guide to exploring the deeper dimensions of life. His life and work serve as reminders that the inner science of yoga is not esoteric philosophy from an outdated past, but is absolutely relevant and applicable to our lives today.
