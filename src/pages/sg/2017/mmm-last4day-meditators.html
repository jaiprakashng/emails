            <p>
                We have just 4 days to go before the event with Sadhguru.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Sadhguru said in a recent call to volunteers, the dire need for today’s world is to raise human consciousness, so all of us need to go all out and offer this to everyone we know. It’s upto them whether they come or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Post this event, we really don’t know when we will have this precious opportunity of having Sadhguru again with us.  So, now is really the time to book your tickets if you still haven’t and let everyone possible know about this.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Regards,<br/>Isha Volunteers</p>
