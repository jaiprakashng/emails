                The countdown has now started for Sadhguru's event on 22nd January. Over the last 10 years of Isha in Singapore, we have seen lives transform on a daily basis. We hope that Sadhguru's presence in Singapore is a catalyst to make the much precious technologies for wellbeing accessible to everyone.
