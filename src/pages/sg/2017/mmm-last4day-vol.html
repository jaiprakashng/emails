                Dear {{{{raw}}}}{{FIRST_NAME}}{{{{/raw}}}},
            </p>
            <p>
                We have just 4 days to go before the event with Sadhguru.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Sadhguru said in a recent call to volunteers, the dire need for today’s world is to raise human consciousness, so he spoke that all of us need to go all out and offer this to everyone we know. It’s upto them whether they come or not. And we need to do this joyfully otherwise the whole purpose may be defeated! :)
            </p>
            <p>
                It was very inspiring to see that in spite of his very hectic schedule, Sadhguru took time out and spoke to all of us. His entire life is devoted towards bringing these technologies for transformation to every human being. He wants to reach out to all 7 billion people on this planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                For all of us, knowing Sadhguru has opened up a new dimension of life and touched our lives in various ways. Post this event, we really don’t know when we will have this precious opportunity of having Sadhguru again with us. So, when he is going all out, it is all the more needed that we do everything possible to ensure that everyone at least knows about him.
            </p>
            <p>
                With tickets available from 25$ onwards, no pre-requisite and chinese translation, this time it is available to people from all backgrounds!
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if they don’t come, Sadhguru mentioned that we can at least make inner engineering book available to everyone. This is a program by itself in the privacy of their home!

                Few people have enquired whether this will be available. Yes, it will be available for remaining seats only! If you have not purchased your ticket until the event day, you can still get it at Expo, on the day, although we cannot guarantee that your preferred seating category will be available.
